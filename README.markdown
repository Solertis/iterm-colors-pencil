# Pencil for iTerm

A color scheme inspired by iA Writer.  Inspired by [@reedes][reedes]'s original
[vim] version, I wanted it in the terminal, and a dark version as well.

There are color declarations included for both `mutt` and `tmux` with colors
that play well with both versions, and they are designed to work seamlessly
across the light and dark versions theme.
